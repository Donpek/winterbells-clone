winterbells-clone or "A Winter Bells clone in C using SDL2"

This is my third game clone in C. The first one I didn't even make into a working game, the second one wasn't too much of a mess, but there're still plenty of things I can add like sound effects, music, score, levels, menu screen, highscore etc.

The game this time is Orisinal's "Winter Bells". (www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells/htm)

My intentions with this attempt are to:
- use git throughout the project (and to make genuine use of it, hopefully)
- give a shot at an improved, more meaningful file and code structure
- write a set of general-use functions to display text in-game via SDL2_ttf
- clean up the already-written graphics and logger modules
- successfully add sound to the game (the Christmas-y music in that game is absolutely lovely)
- write a module for handling frame-based animation
- make the game run on Linux as well as on Windows
- end up with something more polished than all of my previous attempts at games
- write a postmortem after I feel like I'm done with it
- figure out where the Goldilocks zone of the ratio of global vs. local variables lies

All of that being said, let's go!
